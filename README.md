# AgroSmart GCP V6 🌱

AgroSmart GCP V6 is a smart irrigation system designed with a **cloud-first architecture**, built entirely on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

The goal of this project is to create a scalable, secure, and production-ready IoT solution capable of monitoring environmental conditions and automating irrigation decisions in real time.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

This system aims to:

- Monitor soil and weather conditions using IoT devices
- Process telemetry data in the cloud
- Automate irrigation based on intelligent rules
- Provide real-time visualization through a mobile app
- Be fully scalable using managed cloud services

---

## ☁️ Google Cloud Technologies (Planned)

The project is being architected using **100% Google Cloud services**, including:

- **Cloud IoT / MQTT Bridge** *(or alternative MQTT broker on GCP)*
- **Pub/Sub** — event-driven device communication  
- **Cloud Functions / Cloud Run** — backend processing  
- **Firestore / BigQuery** — data storage and analytics  
- **Cloud Scheduler** — automation jobs  
- **Terraform** — infrastructure as code  
- **Firebase** — authentication and mobile integration  
- **Cloud Monitoring & Logging** — observability  

> The architecture may evolve as the system grows.
